# pokedexLockout
Tracker for pokemon catch 'em all lockout (lockout bingo with pokedexes)

This is hardcoded for the gen 1 kanto pokedex
It uses Web rtc to connect to the other person and I'm not hosting any server to find people so you have to do the handshake semi-manually.
I tried to make it easy though, basically just send the text it gives you to the other person over some sort of IM and follow the directions

###Changes to hard-code a gen2 version.
